                <p>"Only with increased capacity can we create a more inclusive program that attacks a great number of students to participate in physical and social activity. The Students' Association is commited to and focused on programming that results in our students taking person ownership for their health."</p>

                <p>at Algonquin College is endless. We currently have the Algonquin College Commons Theatre where we host a variety of events. Now with the coming of the ARC facility, not only will it be providing more space for the students to study, but it will also be bringing in more room for late-night entertainment.</p>
